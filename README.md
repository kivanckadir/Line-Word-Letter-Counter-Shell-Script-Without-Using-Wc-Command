Scientists who think that children learn aggressive behaviour from TV

also emphasize that parents have the power over what their children

watch. Because of this, many scientists recommend a number of things

that parents can do. Reduce the amount of hours of TV that your

children watch, watch at least one episode of the shows your children

watch, and when they see a violent act on the show that their

children are watching, discuss it with your child and tell them that

this kind of behaviour is not good and not the way to solve problems.
