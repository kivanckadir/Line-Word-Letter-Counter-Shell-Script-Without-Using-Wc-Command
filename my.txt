Scientists who think that children learn aggressive behaviour from TV
also emphasize that parents have the power over what their children
watch. Because of this, many scientists recommend a number of things
that parents can do. Reduce the amount of hours of TV that your
children watch, watch at least one episode of the shows your children
watch, and when they see a violent act on the show that their
children are watching, discuss it with your child and tell them that
this kind of behaviour is not good and not the way to solve problems.
